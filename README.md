### SIT223 - Professional Practice Task 6.1C
This task requires the implementation of a Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline build using Jenkins and other build and testing automation tools of our choosing. The selected automation tools chosen for this task are detailed below. 

#### Gradle 
Gradle is a build automation tool commonly used for Java, Groovy, and Android projects, although it supports multiple languages and platforms. It allows developers to automate the tasks related to building, testing, deploying, and managing software. Gradle uses a domain-specific language (DSL) based on Groovy or Kotlin to define the project configuration, dependencies, tasks, and more.

#### JUnit
JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java applications. It allows developers to write unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components of their software. JUnit provides annotations and assertions to define test methods and validate outcomes. JUnit tests help in test-driven development (TDD) and are typically integrated into continuous integration pipelines.

#### Jasmine
Jasmine is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript libraries and does not require a DOM (Document Object Model). Jasmine provides a clean, straightforward syntax for writing test cases. It is often used for testing front-end JavaScript code and Node.js applications.

#### SonarQube
SonarQube is an open-source platform used for continuous inspection of code quality. It performs static code analysis to identify code smells, security vulnerabilities, and other issues in code bases. It supports multiple programming languages and integrates with various CI/CD tools. SonarQube provides a dashboard to visualize and manage code quality metrics, helping teams adhere to coding standards and improve software quality.

#### Veracode
Veracode is an application security solution that focuses on identifying security vulnerabilities in application code. It supports multiple languages and frameworks and can be integrated into the development process at various stages, including the CI/CD pipeline. Veracode performs static, dynamic, and manual analyses to identify security issues, providing detailed reports and recommendations to help developers remediate vulnerabilities.
